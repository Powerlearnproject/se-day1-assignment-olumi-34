# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering principles for software product design, deployment, testing and create a system of maintenance for high quality software 
software engineering has helped the technology sector in the : design and development of software products, evaluation and testing new software programs , create seamless flow of data across the world wide web, writing and testing codes and ensuring platform compatibility 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968: The term "software engineering" is coined by Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist who worked on the Apollo Guidance Computer.
. 1970s: Structured programming emerges, emphasizing modular code and top-down design.
 1972: The first software engineering conference is held, recognizing software engineering as a distinct field.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning phase wherethe goals, scope and target audience are ideated 
requirements gathering stage where the user requirements both functional and non-functional are gathered 
project design where the User interface and User experience are designed with data models 
implementation (coding) stage where high quality testables codes are written, unit testing and implementing functionality 
testing stage . functional tests, performance test and security test is runned
deployment syage where the software us ready for release it involves configuration of product environment and set up infrastructure 
maintenance stage: monitoring and fixing after product release issues 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodologies are linear, sequencial, predictive , phase based and complex to change one executed. 
while 
Agile methodologies are interactive, flexible , collaborative, adaptive and risk tolerant 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
